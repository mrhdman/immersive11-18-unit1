# # - Programming languages see different types of variables
# # differently
# # - String - it's just a bunch of words between quotes for English users
# # - Number - Something with numbers
# # Floats, Integers
# # -- float = it has a . in it

# # - list - list of things. a single variable with a bunch of parts
# # - Dictionaries - variable of variables
# # - Objects - super dictionaries

# # Primitive Data types - string, number, boolean
